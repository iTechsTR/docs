# Security Release Process

If a security fix release is required, run through the below steps.

## Release Timeline

Notes:
- All cut-off dates are based on 10am ([San Francisco Time](http://everytimezone.com/)) on the day stated.
- T-minus counts are measured in "working days" (weekdays other than major holidays concurrent in US and Canada) prior to release day.

### A. (T-minus 4 working days) Code Complete

1. QA Release Manager:
    - Once the list of security issues to be fixed is finalized, post this checklist in Release Checklist channel
    - Make a post in Announcements channel announcing the security release to the rest of the team with links to approved tickets and include a link to the ticket to submit the GitLab MR
2. Operations:
    - Notify community about upcoming security release through a Twitter announcement and in changelog with links to approved fixes and a date tagged as "TBD"
3. Dev Ops:
    - Cherry pick bug fixes to the release branch, unless completed by devs
4. PM GitLab Relationship Owner:
    - If appropriate, open an issue in [GitLab Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) mentioning a security release is coming if it affects their build. [See example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/3099)
      - Open a ticket to [submit Gitlab Omnibus RC install of Mattermost](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-10365)
    - Email GitLab release team about upcoming security release.

### B. (T-minus 3 working days) Release Candidate Cut

1. Dev Ops:
    - Cut new RCs after verifying with QA Release Manager (approved fixes should be merged)
    
### C. (T-minus 2 working days) Release Candidate Testing

1. QA Release Manager:
    - If the dot release takes place during a regular release, update ``ci-linux-mysql-prev`` to dot-release RCs for the previous release and keep ``rctesting.reddogsofwar`` on the latest regular release version
    - Test the new RC to verify fixes merged to the release branch work
    - Post in Release Discussion channel after testing
2. Logistics:
    - If the security researcher has not previously received a security researcher mug, order one for them 

### D. (T-minus 0 working days) Release Build Cut

Once security fix release is ready to cut:

1. Dev Ops:
    - Tag a new release (e.g. 1.1.1) and run an official build
    - Verify hashes and GPG signatures are correct, once build is cut
    - Delete RCs after final version is shipped
2. QA Release Manager:
     - Update the changelog
     - Update the [version archive](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/version-archive.html)

      - Test the download links before and after updating the page
3. Operations:
    - Contact owners of [community installers](http://www.mattermost.org/installation/) or submit PRs to update install version number

      - Update Security Issues spreadsheet with issue number from posted update (e.g. v3.2.0.1)
4. PM GitLab Relationship Owner:
    - Work with a developer to submit GitLab MR [following this process](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/gitlab-process.html#merge-requests) and [test the upgrade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbeu2XXwCpbz3qz7y_6yDIYBToyY2nW0NFZq9Gdei1E/edit#heading=h.ncq9ltn04isg) once the GitLab MR is merged and included in their RC.
